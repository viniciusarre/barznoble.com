# Barz Noble 

## How to get the project working

This is the react refactor for the barznoble website. It was built with create-react-app and some other npm dependencies. 
To get started, please, clone the project and browse to its folder using the terminal and then run 
[npm install]

This will download all the dependencies for the project into the folder node_modules. 

Then simply run [npm start] for starting the projectâ€™s server (it will probably use the port 3000, so, to view the project, navigate to localhost:3000 using the browser). 


For a build version of it, run 

[npm run build]
