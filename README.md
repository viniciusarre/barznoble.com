This is the website for Barz Noble which is hosted here. I have refactored it from PhP and Jquery to React. http://www.barznoble.com/


# What was used in the website?

The project was made with React for rendering components and the pages and react-router for the route structure. 

# Running the project

In order to test it, one should run npm install and then npm start inside of the project folder.
